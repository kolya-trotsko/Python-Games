 used modules -
    from turtle import *
    from time import sleep
    from random import randint

 Description: With the help of the turtle module used to visualize the game, other standard Python
 modules with which the game process itself was created, and the OOP skills, the well-known game 
 "Snake" was created. The result can be compiled and viewed. the program can be improved if you 
 use for visualization not turtle, but another, newer module. With the help of this module you 
 can speed up the gameplay and remove the delay after the steps of the "snake". It is also 
 possible to improve the appearance of the game itself (add the main menu, save the process after 
 logging out with json, and achieve interest in the game process)
