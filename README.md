  from turtle import * 

Description: 
With the help of the turtle module used to visualize the game, the well-known game "Tik tak toe" was created. 
The result can be collected and viewed. The program can be improved by adding use to the OOP, 
but since this task is considered by students who have not yet studied PLO, I tried to do without it. 
You can also improve the appearance of the game itself (add the main menu, add points for passing the game. 
I also plan to add an opponent and several levels where the opponent will become stronger.)
